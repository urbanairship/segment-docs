## Airship (Actions) Destination

{% include content/plan-grid.md name="actions" %}


[Airship](https://app.segment.com/airship/destinations/catalog/actions-airship) provides an end-to-end solution for capturing value across the entire customer app lifecycle — from acquisition and activation to engagement and loyalty. It starts with Airship’s market-leading app store optimization (ASO) solutions promoting app discovery and downloads. Then our unified journey orchestration, content creation and experimentation solutions kick in. App teams can quickly design, deploy and iterate no-code native app experiences and cross-channel campaigns — bridging inside-the-app experiences with outside-the-app messaging.

This destination is maintained by Airship. For any issues with the destination, [contact their Support team](mailto:support@airship.com).

> **Good to know**: This page is about the [Actions-framework](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/) Airship Segment destination. There's also a page about the [non-Actions Airship destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/airship/). Both of these destinations receive data from Segment.

## Benefits of Airship (Actions) vs Airship Classic

Airship (Actions) provides the following benefits over the classic Airship destination:

- **Flexibility**. Complete flexibility for mapping your data from any Segment event type to one of three Airship endpoints. Make optimal use of data from Segment to trigger Automations, for audience segmentation, or to personalize end-users in-app experiences and messages.
- **Reporting**. Better and more meaningful feedback from the Airship API. This integration calls the Airship API directly, so the endpoint response shows precisely how the integration is performing.
